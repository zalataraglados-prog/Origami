## What Origami is

Origami is a **single-user unified inbox**. It is not a shared team helpdesk and it does not try to fully mirror every mailbox feature.

Current provider support:

- **Gmail** — read + send
- **Outlook** — read + send
- **QQ Mail** — read only via IMAP

## What is intentionally local

Origami keeps several states inside its own database instead of pushing them back to the source mailbox:

- Done
- Archive
- Snooze
- Local sent-message history

Read / Star are different: for supported providers, they can optionally be written back when the corresponding account-level toggle is enabled.

This keeps the core triage model fast and provider-agnostic, while still allowing selected mailbox state to stay in sync when you want it.
